## Assignment To-Do List

My project is a simple school to-do list application. All you need to do is submit your assignment, the class it's for, and the deadline, and all that information will be tracked alongside a derived field letting you know the priority of the assignment. The CSS positioning was done using flexbox. I used all three types of CSS selectors and I also used Google Font "Roboto".

You can also run the project locally by running `node server.js` and visiting `localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Application uses a single-page design that updates the data display without requiring a page refresh.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Another student (Camren Chraplak) tested out my interface and gave me his feedback. 

Here's what he said:
One problem he noticed was that he was able to submit empty data entries, which would fill up the data table with empty rows (aside from priorities, which would default to "Low" without a deadline). Luckily, this didn't break the application at all.
He thought it would be nice if it was made clearer how priority was determined based on the deadline. This gave me the idea for an improvement that could be made to the application, a feature allowing the user to set exactly what time ranges they would classify as "High", "Medium", and "Low" priorities.
